      .entry
        .content I have a constant drive to discover the most interesting and important problems to solve.  I want to bring my experience and expertise to diverse teams in an effort to reduce the most complex problems into elegant solutions using a human-centered design approach.

        .content My career has been standing on the shoulders of giants, so it’s only fair to reference them here:

          li “Unless you begin with an interesting problem, it is unlikely you will end up with an interesting solution.” - Bob Gill
          li “If I had 60 minutes to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes defining it, and 5 minutes solving it. ” - Albert Einstein
          li “Don’t undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible.” - Edwin Land
